/*
Sum All Odd Fibonacci Numbers

Return the sum of all odd Fibonacci numbers up to and including the passed number if it is a Fibonacci number.

The first few numbers of the Fibonacci sequence are 1, 1, 2, 3, 5 and 8, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two numbers.

As an example, passing 4 to the function should return 5 because all the odd Fibonacci numbers under 4 are 1, 1, and 3.

sumFibs(4);
