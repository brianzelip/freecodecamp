Query Wikipedia and display results in HTML using client-side javascript and the WikiMedia API

I'm trying to build a third party single-page web app that allows a user to:
  a) input key word(s) into a text box,
  b) search English Wikipedia for the input key word(s) using client-side javascript and the MediaWiki API, and,
  c) display the search results as a list containing links to the Wikipedia pages that contains the key word(s).
