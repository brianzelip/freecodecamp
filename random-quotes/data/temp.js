var quotesArr = ["Fashion fades, only style remains the same.","You can design and create, and build the most wonderful place in the world. But it takes people to make the dream a reality.","Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.","Good design is making something intelligible and memorable. Great design is making something memorable and meaningful.","The details are not the details. They make the design.","Eventually everything connects - people, ideas, objects. The quality of the connections is the key to quality per se.","Design is a funny word. Some people think design means how it looks. But of course, if you dig deeper, it's really how it works.","A shoe is not only a design, but it's a part of your body language, the way you walk. The way you're going to move is quite dictated by your shoes.","Design is a constant challenge to balance comfort with luxe, the practical with the desirable.","What is design? It's where you stand with a foot in two worlds - the world of technology and the world of people and human purposes - and you try to bring the two together.","A designer knows he has achieved perfection not when there is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.","Engineering, medicine, business, architecture and painting are concerned not with the necessary but with the contingent - not with how things are but with how they might be - in short, with design.","Graphic design is the paradise of individuality, eccentricity, heresy, abnormality, hobbies and humors.","Sometimes I can't figure designers out. It's as if they flunked human anatomy.","Design is the method of putting form and content together. Design, just as art, has multiple definitions; there is no single definition. Design can be art. Design can be aesthetics. Design is so simple, that's why it is so complicated.","It's all in how you arrange the thing... the careful balance of the design is the motion.","Many things difficult to design prove easy to performance.","A camel is a horse designed by committee.","Space is the breath of art.","I'm not like most designers, who have to set sail on an exotic getaway to get inspired. Most of the time, it's on my walk to work, or sitting in the subway and seeing something random or out of context.","I think it's really important to design things with a kind of personality.","Fashion is architecture: it is a matter of proportions.","Designing is a matter of concentration. You go deep into what you want to do. It's about intensive research, really. The concentration is warm and intimate and like the fire inside the earth - intense but not distorted. You can go to a place, really feel it in your heart. It's actually a beautiful feeling.","Graphic design, which evokes the symmetria of Vituvius, the dynamic symmetry of Hambidge, the asymmetry of Mondrian; which is a good gestalt, generated by intuition or by computer, by invention or by a system of coordinates, is not good design if it does not communicate.","Good design doesn't date. Bad design does.","Design works if it's authentic, inspired, and has a clear point of view. It can't be a collection of input.","Some men give up their designs when they have almost reached the goal; While others, on the contrary, obtain a victory by exerting, at the last moment, more vigorous efforts than ever before.","The proper study of mankind is the science of design.","Design is not for philosophy it's for life.","To whom does design address itself: to the greatest number, to the specialist of an enlightened matter, to a privileged social class? Design addresses itself to the need.","To design is to communicate clearly by whatever means you can control or master.","All conventional wisdom has an element of truth to it, but good design requires more than an element of truth - it requires an ensemble of correct assumptions and valid calculations.","I'm a designer, and I think if you work in fashion, you have to give people fantasy.","In my opinion, no single design is apt to be optimal for everyone.","I like the body. I like to design everything to do with the body.","About half my designs are controlled fantasy, 15 percent are total madness and the rest are bread-and-butter designs.","I don't design clothes, I design dreams.","Design must reflect the practical and aesthetic in business but above all... good design must primarily serve people.","Good design doesn't date.","I don't start with a design objective, I start with a communication objective. I feel my project is successful if it communicates what it is supposed to communicate.","Any product that needs a manual to work is broken.","Design is not making beauty, beauty emerges from selection, affinities, integration, love.","Color does not add a pleasant quality to design - it reinforces it.","Designs are increasingly winning competitions because they are literally green, and because somewhere they feature a small windmill.","Space and light and order. Those are the things that men need just as much as they need bread or a place to sleep.","Design is about creating spaces for people to enjoy and of course, creating moments where you elevate the spirit, but 'design for good' is figuring out a program that not only creates better spaces, but creates jobs, creates new industry and really kind of raises the conversation about how we rebuild.","It's a very strange thing for a designer to say, but one of the things that really irritates me in products is when I'm aware of designers wagging their tails in my face.","Good design is good business.","Buildings designed with careful attention to aesthetics arouse and enlighten their occupants and that promotes their good health.","When I design buildings, I think of the overall composition, much as the parts of a body would fit together. On top of that, I think about how people will approach the building and experience that space.","Chandeliers are marvels of drop-dead showiness, the jewellery of architecture.","Recognizing the need is the primary condition for design.","I design for real people. I think of our customers all the time. There is no virtue whatsoever in creating clothing or accessories that are not practical.","Everyone designs who devises courses of action aimed at changing existing situations into preferred ones.","Clothes and jewellery should be startling, individual. When you see a woman in my clothes, you want to know more about them. To me, that is what distinguishes good designers from bad designers.","Design is directed toward human beings. To design is to solve human problems by identifying them and executing the best solution.","Design is an unknown.","Delay always breeds danger; and to protract a great design is often to ruin it.","A chair is a very difficult object. A skyscraper is almost easier. That is why Chippendale is famous.","Perhaps believing in good design is like believing in God, it makes you an optimist.","Design is so critical it should be on the agenda of every meeting in every single department.","Design is people.","Designers are very fickle. I never wanted to be a victim of that. You're in one minute, out the next.","I would think twice about designing stuff for which there was no need and which didn't endure.","Design is everything. Everything!","So, to really execute design in its highest form and making people feel joy, that's a great reward.","Accessible design is good design.","A good designer must rely on experience, on precise, logic thinking; and on pedantic exactness. No magic will do.","Every contrivance of man, every tool, every instrument, every utensil, every article designed for use, of each and every kind, evolved from a very simple beginnings.","In the end, I hope there's a little note somewhere that says I designed a good computer.","I think there is a new awareness in this 21st century that design is as important to where and how we live as it is for museums, concert halls and civic buildings.","Luck is the residue of design.","The details are the very source of expression in architecture. But we are caught in a vice between art and the bottom line.","We design our world, while our world acts back on us and designs us.","The urge for good design is the same as the urge to go on living.","This is what I like about being a designer: You can't really get it until you see it.","Designs of purely arbitrary nature cannot be expected to last long.","Everyday people are not very good designers.","The primary factor is proportions.","The design of each element should be thought out in order to be easy to make and easy to repair.","It is only after years of preparation that the young artist should touch color - not color used descriptively, that is, but as a means of personal expression.","Great designers seldom make great advertising men, because they get overcome by the beauty of the picture - and forget that merchandise must be sold.","A designer is only as good as the star who wears her clothes.","The aim of being a good designer is to have an influence. If you design furniture or lifestyle, you should influence the way people evolve globally. It's good to have an influence.","Anyone with a computer and a design program can create a page layout. But unless you're trained in design, it won't look very good and it won't communicate very well.","Good design is good business.","The artist in me cries out for design.","Designs in connection with postage stamps and coinage may be described, I think, as the silent ambassadors on national taste.","I design for the woman who loves being a woman.","Complexity is one of the great problems in environmental design.","If I have a style, I am not aware of it.","I've learned a tremendous amount over the years by watching designers work. I now have a good understanding of what sits well on the body, not to mention the importance of a great cut and quality.","I like stuff designed by dead people. The old designers. They always got it right because they didn't have to grow up with computers. All of the people that made the spoon and the dishes and the vacuum cleaner didn't have microprocessors and stuff. You could do a good design back then.","In designing hardware to be used every day, it was important to keep both the human aspects and the machine in mind. What looks good also often feels good.","Outside of the chair, the teapot is the most ubiquitous and important design element in the domestic environment and almost everyone who has tackled the world of design has ended up designing one.","Sacred spaces can be created in any environment.","British innovation in design, in the creative arts, in engineering and manufacturing is world class.","I would be most content if my children grew up to be the kind of people who think decorating consists mostly of building enough bookshelves.","Happiness is not something you postpone for the future; it is something you design for the present.","If you don't design your own life plan, chances are you'll fall into someone else's plan. And guess what they have planned for you? Not much.","Design is the fundamental soul of a man-made creation that ends up expressing itself in successive outer layers of the product or service. The iMac is not just the color or translucence or the shape of the shell. The essence of the iMac is to be the finest possible consumer computer in which each element plays together.","Design is a way of life, a point of view. It involves the whole complex of visual communications: talent, creative ability, manual skill, and technical knowledge. Aesthetics and economics, technology and psychology are intrinsically related to the process.","The curious task of economics is to demonstrate to men how little they really know about what they imagine they can design.","As all human beings are, in my view, creatures of God's design, we must respect all other human beings. That does not mean I have to agree with their choices or agree with their opinions, but indeed I respect them as human beings."];
