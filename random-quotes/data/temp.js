var quotesArr = ["Fashion fades, only style remains the same.","You can design and create, and build the most wonderful place in the world. But it takes people to make the dream a reality.","Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.","Good design is making something intelligible and memorable. Great design is making something memorable and meaningful.","The details are not the details. They make the design.","Eventually everything connects - people, ideas, objects. The quality of the connections is the key to quality per se.","Design is a funny word. Some people think design means how it looks. But of course, if you dig deeper, it's really how it works.","A shoe is not only a design, but it's a part of your body language, the way you walk. The way you're going to move is quite dictated by your shoes.","Design is a constant challenge to balance comfort with luxe, the practical with the desirable.","What is design? It's where you stand with a foot in two worlds - the world of technology and the world of people and human purposes - and you try to bring the two together.","A designer knows he has achieved perfection not when there is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.","Engineering, medicine, business, architecture and painting are concerned not with the necessary but with the contingent - not with how things are but with how they might be - in short, with design.","Graphic design is the paradise of individuality, eccentricity, heresy, abnormality, hobbies and humors.","Sometimes I can't figure designers out. It's as if they flunked human anatomy.","Design is the method of putting form and content together. Design, just as art, has multiple definitions; there is no single definition. Design can be art. Design can be aesthetics. Design is so simple, that's why it is so complicated.","It's all in how you arrange the thing... the careful balance of the design is the motion.","Many things difficult to design prove easy to performance.","A camel is a horse designed by committee.","Space is the breath of art.","I'm not like most designers, who have to set sail on an exotic getaway to get inspired. Most of the time, it's on my walk to work, or sitting in the subway and seeing something random or out of context.","I think it's really important to design things with a kind of personality.","Fashion is architecture: it is a matter of proportions.","Designing is a matter of concentration. You go deep into what you want to do. It's about intensive research, really. The concentration is warm and intimate and like the fire inside the earth - intense but not distorted. You can go to a place, really feel it in your heart. It's actually a beautiful feeling.","Graphic design, which evokes the symmetria of Vituvius, the dynamic symmetry of Hambidge, the asymmetry of Mondrian; which is a good gestalt, generated by intuition or by computer, by invention or by a system of coordinates, is not good design if it does not communicate.","Good design doesn't date. Bad design does.","Design works if it's authentic, inspired, and has a clear point of view. It can't be a collection of input."];
