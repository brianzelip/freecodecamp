["I design for real people. I think of our customers all the time. There is no virtue whatsoever in creating clothing or accessories that are not practical.","Everyone designs who devises courses of action aimed at changing existing situations into preferred ones.","Clothes and jewellery should be startling, individual. When you see a woman in my clothes, you want to know more about them. To me, that is what distinguishes good designers from bad designers.","Design is directed toward human beings. To design is to solve human problems by identifying them and executing the best solution.","Design is an unknown.","Delay always breeds danger; and to protract a great design is often to ruin it.","A chair is a very difficult object. A skyscraper is almost easier. That is why Chippendale is famous.","Perhaps believing in good design is like believing in God, it makes you an optimist.","Design is so critical it should be on the agenda of every meeting in every single department.","Design is people.","Designers are very fickle. I never wanted to be a victim of that. You're in one minute, out the next.","I would think twice about designing stuff for which there was no need and which didn't endure.","Design is everything. Everything!","So, to really execute design in its highest form and making people feel joy, that's a great reward.","Accessible design is good design.","A good designer must rely on experience, on precise, logic thinking; and on pedantic exactness. No magic will do.","Every contrivance of man, every tool, every instrument, every utensil, every article designed for use, of each and every kind, evolved from a very simple beginnings.","In the end, I hope there's a little note somewhere that says I designed a good computer.","I think there is a new awareness in this 21st century that design is as important to where and how we live as it is for museums, concert halls and civic buildings.","Luck is the residue of design.","The details are the very source of expression in architecture. But we are caught in a vice between art and the bottom line.","We design our world, while our world acts back on us and designs us.","The urge for good design is the same as the urge to go on living.","This is what I like about being a designer: You can't really get it until you see it.","Designs of purely arbitrary nature cannot be expected to last long.","Everyday people are not very good designers."]
