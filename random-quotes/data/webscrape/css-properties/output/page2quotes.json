["Some men give up their designs when they have almost reached the goal; While others, on the contrary, obtain a victory by exerting, at the last moment, more vigorous efforts than ever before.","The proper study of mankind is the science of design.","Design is not for philosophy it's for life.","To whom does design address itself: to the greatest number, to the specialist of an enlightened matter, to a privileged social class? Design addresses itself to the need.","To design is to communicate clearly by whatever means you can control or master.","All conventional wisdom has an element of truth to it, but good design requires more than an element of truth - it requires an ensemble of correct assumptions and valid calculations.","I'm a designer, and I think if you work in fashion, you have to give people fantasy.","In my opinion, no single design is apt to be optimal for everyone.","I like the body. I like to design everything to do with the body.","About half my designs are controlled fantasy, 15 percent are total madness and the rest are bread-and-butter designs.","I don't design clothes, I design dreams.","Design must reflect the practical and aesthetic in business but above all... good design must primarily serve people.","Good design doesn't date.","I don't start with a design objective, I start with a communication objective. I feel my project is successful if it communicates what it is supposed to communicate.","Any product that needs a manual to work is broken.","Design is not making beauty, beauty emerges from selection, affinities, integration, love.","Color does not add a pleasant quality to design - it reinforces it.","Designs are increasingly winning competitions because they are literally green, and because somewhere they feature a small windmill.","Space and light and order. Those are the things that men need just as much as they need bread or a place to sleep.","Design is about creating spaces for people to enjoy and of course, creating moments where you elevate the spirit, but 'design for good' is figuring out a program that not only creates better spaces, but creates jobs, creates new industry and really kind of raises the conversation about how we rebuild.","It's a very strange thing for a designer to say, but one of the things that really irritates me in products is when I'm aware of designers wagging their tails in my face.","Good design is good business.","Buildings designed with careful attention to aesthetics arouse and enlighten their occupants and that promotes their good health.","When I design buildings, I think of the overall composition, much as the parts of a body would fit together. On top of that, I think about how people will approach the building and experience that space.","Chandeliers are marvels of drop-dead showiness, the jewellery of architecture.","Recognizing the need is the primary condition for design."]
