["The primary factor is proportions.","The design of each element should be thought out in order to be easy to make and easy to repair.","It is only after years of preparation that the young artist should touch color - not color used descriptively, that is, but as a means of personal expression.","Great designers seldom make great advertising men, because they get overcome by the beauty of the picture - and forget that merchandise must be sold.","A designer is only as good as the star who wears her clothes.","The aim of being a good designer is to have an influence. If you design furniture or lifestyle, you should influence the way people evolve globally. It's good to have an influence.","Anyone with a computer and a design program can create a page layout. But unless you're trained in design, it won't look very good and it won't communicate very well.","Good design is good business.","The artist in me cries out for design.","Designs in connection with postage stamps and coinage may be described, I think, as the silent ambassadors on national taste.","I design for the woman who loves being a woman.","Complexity is one of the great problems in environmental design.","If I have a style, I am not aware of it.","I've learned a tremendous amount over the years by watching designers work. I now have a good understanding of what sits well on the body, not to mention the importance of a great cut and quality.","I like stuff designed by dead people. The old designers. They always got it right because they didn't have to grow up with computers. All of the people that made the spoon and the dishes and the vacuum cleaner didn't have microprocessors and stuff. You could do a good design back then.","In designing hardware to be used every day, it was important to keep both the human aspects and the machine in mind. What looks good also often feels good.","Outside of the chair, the teapot is the most ubiquitous and important design element in the domestic environment and almost everyone who has tackled the world of design has ended up designing one.","Sacred spaces can be created in any environment.","British innovation in design, in the creative arts, in engineering and manufacturing is world class.","I would be most content if my children grew up to be the kind of people who think decorating consists mostly of building enough bookshelves.","Happiness is not something you postpone for the future; it is something you design for the present.","If you don't design your own life plan, chances are you'll fall into someone else's plan. And guess what they have planned for you? Not much.","Design is the fundamental soul of a man-made creation that ends up expressing itself in successive outer layers of the product or service. The iMac is not just the color or translucence or the shape of the shell. The essence of the iMac is to be the finest possible consumer computer in which each element plays together.","Design is a way of life, a point of view. It involves the whole complex of visual communications: talent, creative ability, manual skill, and technical knowledge. Aesthetics and economics, technology and psychology are intrinsically related to the process.","The curious task of economics is to demonstrate to men how little they really know about what they imagine they can design.","As all human beings are, in my view, creatures of God's design, we must respect all other human beings. That does not mean I have to agree with their choices or agree with their opinions, but indeed I respect them as human beings."]
